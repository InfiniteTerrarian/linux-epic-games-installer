# linux-epic-games-installer


please run chmod +x to make it executable, this is only for managing your friends as for epic you cannot do this any other way, it is not for installing games as thats what heroic is for.


if you run this command in terminal it should make the whole thing run so you dont need to download the .sh file 
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfiniteTerrarian/linux-epic-games-installer/refs/heads/main/epicinstaller.sh | bash
